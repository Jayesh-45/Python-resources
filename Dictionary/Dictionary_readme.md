> ## Usually a Dictionary is made to store a few words and their meanings or even words and their typical functions and such.

### Here a Dictionary can store multiple words which can be altered, appended and even removed anytime in the program.

1. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.
2. You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets.
3. You can also change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name.

- In this Source code, we have made a dictionary as "Dict1" and added some english words and their meanings.
- **This program works better when opened in terminal, rather than some Python IDE.**
