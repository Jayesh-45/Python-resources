> ## This is the Readme file for the Random module working in Python.

1. This is a program that teaches most of the Python random module.
2. First we have to import the random module in our file to be able to use all the inbuilt module functions.

- We do this by **"import random"**.
3. Now we can use all the functions inside it.
4. The first function is a function that generates any random interval in the inputed range.

	   random.randint(initial value, limit value)

5. This is the syntax for random integer.
6. The next statement prints the random number.
