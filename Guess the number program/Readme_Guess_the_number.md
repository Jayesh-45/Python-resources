> ## This is a program that asks the user to guess the correct number that is coded inside the program file.

Also it shows hints to the user on the console that if the guessed number is greater or smaller than the actual number, and also the no of guesses remaining.
- If the user guesses the number wrong and losses his chances, the console prints..  You lose. 
- For a better experience it is recommended to open this program in the terminal so that the number is clearly not visible to the user.
- The number can be changed and the no of chances to guess also can be changed
- After correctly guessing the number, the program also displays the no of guesses made to guess the number.
