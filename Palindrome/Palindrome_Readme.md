> ## This program is about Finding out if the entered string is a palindrome or not.

### The first program takes a string as input and checks "if" the reverse of the string is same as thee original string.

- This program uses String Slicing Functions i.e.string[::-1] that reverses the string totally.
- Then the program checks if both the strings are the same or not.
- If yes, then the string is a palindrome.

ex. NITIN is a palindrome.

### The second program Finds out if a entered number is Palindrome or not.

- The program takes a number as input and finds reverse or the number, after storinng the original number in a temporary variable.
- Then the program checks if both the original number and the reversed numbers are same or not.
- If yes, then the number is a palindrome.

ex. 101 is a palindrome.
