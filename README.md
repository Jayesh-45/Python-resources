# Python-resources

This is a Online Python resource material repository for beginners.

I am a budding programmer.
I create these little programs as experiments to play with Python, or to solve problems for myself. 
I would gladly accept reviews and suggestions from others to improve, simplify, or make the codes more efficient.

I also provide the working principle and the expected output.
